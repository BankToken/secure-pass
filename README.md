# secure-pass - Introduction
This module is a wrapper for [libsodium]'s implementation of the Argon2ID hashing algorithm. This module also provides a facility for generating secure 1 time use password reset tokens for use in your own password reset logic.

# Features

- Uses the state of the art, secure modern password hashing algorithm [Argon2ID].
- Uses <code>Buffer</code>'s for safer memory management.
- Allows for generation of one time use password reset tokens to be used in your own password reset flow.
- Easily configurable work factors, allowing you to increase the security of your hashes over time.
- Simple rehashing of passwords you are already storing. Allowing you to improve the security of your hashes over time.
